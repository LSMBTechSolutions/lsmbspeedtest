## Introduction
LSMB Speed Test is a network utility designed to measure internet connection speed, check network stability through ping and jitter tests, and perform basic network security checks. The tool provides real-time feedback and logs each process step for enhanced user experience.

## Features
- Download Speed Test: Accurately measures your network's download speed using speedtest-cli and displays the result in Mbps.
- Upload Speed Test: Measures your network's upload speed and provides results in Mbps, helping assess the quality of your internet connection.
- Ping Test: Calculates the latency in milliseconds, showing how quickly your network can send and receive data.
- Jitter Test: Measures the variation in ping times, providing insight into the stability of your connection.
- Network Security Check: Verifies your network's connection to external servers and checks for potential issues with network security.
- Real-Time Process Feedback: Displays a spinner during test execution and a progress bar to track download and upload tests.
- Server Details Display: Fetches a list of available speed test servers and selects the best one based on location for more accurate results.
- Cross-Platform Color Support: Terminal output uses colored text for better clarity and enhanced user experience across different platforms.
- Command-Based Operation: Simple command-line interface for starting tests, stopping them, viewing results, and getting help.
- ASCII Art Banner: Adds a personalized ASCII art header with pyfiglet to give the interface a visually engaging look.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.x: Ensure Python version 3.x is installed on your system.
- Required Python Packages:
  - termcolor: For colored terminal output.
  - colorama: Provides cross-platform color support in the terminal.
  - pyfiglet: Used to generate ASCII art banners.
  - speedtest-cli: The core tool for performing internet speed tests.
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems.
- Internet connection required for performing the speed tests.

## Installation
- Clone the Repository:
  - git clone https://github.com/LSMBGlobalSolutions/lsmbspeedtest.git
- Navigate to the Project Directory:
  - cd lsmbspeedtest
- Install Required Dependencies:
  # pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- Run the Application:
  - python3 main.py

## Usage Instructions
- To start the speed test, run:
  - python3 main.py
- Available Commands:
  - start: Run the full speed test.
  - stop: Stop any running tests.
  - results: View the test results.
  - help: Show available commands.
  - exit: Exit the program.

## Understanding the Results
- Download Speed: Displays the internet's download speed in Mbps.
- Upload Speed: Shows the internet's upload speed in Mbps.
- Ping: Measures network latency in milliseconds (ms), indicating the time taken for data to travel to and from a server.
- Jitter: Calculates the variation in ping times, reflecting the stability of the network connection.
- Network Security: Displays whether the network is securely connected to an external server and shows the external IP address.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- Verify that all required packages are installed:
  - termcolor, colorama, pyfiglet, speedtest-cli.
- Check your internet connection if speed tests fail or give unexpected results.
- Run the script with administrator privileges if necessary, especially on Windows.
- If the application crashes, review the error messages for missing dependencies or permission issues.

## Code Breakdown
- main.py: Contains the core logic of the network speed test tool.
- Spinner: Provides visual feedback while processes are running.
- Progress Bar: Displays real-time progress for download and upload tests.
- show_server_details: Retrieves and displays available speed test servers.
- test_download_speed: Measures and reports the download speed of the internet connection.
- test_upload_speed: Measures and reports the upload speed of the internet connection.
- test_ping_jitter: Performs a ping and jitter test to evaluate network latency and stability.
- check_network_security: Verifies the networkâ€™s security by checking the external IP connection.
- print_test_results: Outputs a summary of all the test results.
- handle_command: Processes user commands such as start, stop, and results.
